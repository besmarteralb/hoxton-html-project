            <p>Traveling on different modes of transportation with others can come with varying degrees of risk during the pandemic. Here’s what to know.
                In general, the fewer people you are exposed to during travel, the lower your COVID-19 risk will be.As you make plans for trips this holiday season, you may be wondering which mode of transportation would be best to take as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.
                Is it safer to travel by train or plane cross-country? Is a bus more convenient? What are the different requirements and safety protocols for each?
                Should you just hop in your own car?
                These are just some of the many questions people are asking themselves as they contemplate traveling during the holiday season this year.</p>
                
                
            <p>Can your COVID-19 risk vary depending on the mode of public transportation you take?
                Dr. Kavitha Prabaker, assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at UCLA Health, told Healthline that the level of COVID-19 risk you might be willing to tolerate during this travel-heavy holiday season will depend on a number of factors regarding your health, including:
                 if you or a member of your household have any immunocompromising conditions the potential consequences of getting ill or getting exposed to the coronavirus (which might mean missing school or work, or needing to find child care)
                your own vaccination status and that of your children or other household members. 
                “In general, the fewer people you are exposed to during travel, the lower your risk of COVID-19 infection will be. Travel by plane, train, or bus during busy times, including the upcoming holiday season, may expose you to others who may be sick or unknowingly infected with COVID-19,” said Prabaker, who also serves as associate director of clinical epidemiology and infection prevention at UCLA Santa Monica, and associate director of the antimicrobial stewardship program at UCLA Health.
                She explained that the key risk of contracting the coronavirus comes from sitting closely to others, since respiratory droplets can travel with ease to your eyes, nose, and mouth.
                “The risk of acquiring COVID-19 from an infected individual on the other side of the airplane, bus, or train is low, as long as there is adequate ventilation — high efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filters or open windows,” she said.
                “Traveling alone or with household members by car is the safest option. The risk of traveling by airplane, train, or bus is likely similar, and this risk increases with the number of people sitting within 6 feet of you. You should also consider the COVID-19 prevalence in your destination when planning a trip,” she added.</p>
                
                <p>Alex Butler, senior editor at Lonely Planet, said safety procedures and COVID-19 guidelines can vary between different modes of public transportation depending on your location.
                “Most countries require people to wear face masks, regardless of their vaccination status, on public transport. Cloth masks are generally accepted on trains, buses, and ferries. However, some airlines have strict mask policies, where cloth masks are banned and passengers are required to use single-use medical masks on their flight,” Butler told Healthline.
                She said it’s important to check your airline’s policy when booking tickets, and make sure you have the right mask when boarding.
                Butler added that, in the United States, vaccination proof isn’t required for boarding domestic flights, but in some countries it is.
                For instance, in France and Italy, you’ll need to present your proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to board a domestic flight as well as long-distance trains.
                “When flying internationally, you’re generally supposed to show you’re not infected with COVID-19 through either a recent negative test or a vaccine — or recovery cert — and sometimes even both. Though proof of vaccination is increasingly becoming the standard,” Butler said.
                “Make sure that you know what the vaccine and testing requirements are for your specific mode of transportation before you travel. Also be aware of the local requirements for testing and quarantine, if required, for your destination,” Prabaker added.
                Guidelines can vary between locations and modes of transportation.</p>
                 
                <p>Butler said that most travel and transportation companies list their COVID-19-related policies on their official websites.
                All major airlines as well as bus and train companies also have informational phone numbers you can call to try to reach a customer services representative who might be able to clarify any confusing points.
                “It’s important to remember that different countries have different rules, so some international airlines will have very different policies than U.S. airlines. For example, Air France and Lufthansa do not allow cloth masks, so if you’re traveling internationally, always double-check,” Butler explained.
                “In fact, it’s a good idea to keep a variety of masks ⁠— cloth, surgical, and N95 ⁠— on hand so you can meet requirements as needed. The rules can still change with little notice, so being prepared for anything is always the safest bet,” she said.
                Is there a safest mode of transportation?</p>

                <p>Butler said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends delaying any travel until you are fully vaccinated.
                “From there, any situation where you’re interacting with lots of people, like on public transport or airplanes, still carries a risk of contracting or spreading the disease⁠. That means that travelers need to base their decisions on their own level of comfort,” she said.
                “A private vehicle may be the best option if you are really trying to limit potential exposure⁠ — and it may be the best choice for anyone concerned about traveling with unvaccinated kids,” Butler added.
                She also said that if you were planning on using Amtrak to travel cross-country by train, you could consider booking a private room “to help limit your exposure to others.”
                Additionally, if you’re flying, Butler added you should be prepared to take all necessary precautions, both in the airport and on the plane.
                If you’re going by bus, similar recommendations apply.</p>

                <p> The CDC requiresTrusted Source you to wear a mask in indoor transit hubs as well as inside buses.
                Traveling a great distance when close to others on a bus isn’t unlike a train or a plane. It also comes with risks, but as with choosing any method, you have to assess how comfortable you are with long-distance travel during this time.
                
                <p> <b> Travel tips from the experts at Lonely  </b>
                If possible, reserve your seats ahead of time to ensure you’re sitting next to a household member.
                If you’ll be sitting next to someone you don’t know, consider wearing a face shield in addition to a mask.
                If you’re traveling by bus or train, choose seats next to doors or open windows, where ventilation is highest.
                Reserve travel during less busy times.
                Avoid travel if and when COVID-19 rates are high in your community or in your destination.
                Check in online and print your travel documents before getting to the airport to limit the time spent standing in lines and using airport kiosks.
                Keep at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others whenever possible while in airports and train or bus stations.
                Avoid eating and drinking during travel on public transportation if your trip is short enough to allow for this.</p>
                
                <p> <b> How to reduce your risk</b>
                With all this information at your disposal, you still might be anxious about any kind of travel during this continued health crisis.
                “If you are immunocompromised or very concerned about COVID-19, I recommend that you travel by car alone or only with members of your household,” Prabaker said.
                “Vaccination is by far the most effective way to reduce your risk of COVID-19 during travel. If you have already been fully vaccinated, you may be eligible for a booster shot or a supplemental vaccine,” she said.
                At the end of the day, Prabaker said it’s about ensuring you and those around you remain safe.
                You not only have to make sure you do the research to determine what is the best way to travel for you, but also how you can keep others safe along the way.
                “Any travel will increase your risk of acquiring COVID-19, but with vaccination and the above recommendations, you can reduce your risk to a minimal amount this holiday season, and enjoy time spent on family, friends, and new adventures,” Prabaker said.
                For many people, this year may bring unique stressors when considering holiday travel.
                More than a year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic and heading into the second holiday season living with the virus, it’s safe to say stress levels for Americans are still sky-high.
                The latest data from the American Psychological Association’s Stress in America poll found that 1 in 3 survey respondents report feeling stressed about the coronavirus pandemic and that they have difficulty making even fundamental decisions, such as what to wear or what to eat.
                Though the usual stressors come with the holidays and holiday travel, there’s a lot to consider while navigating it all through an ever-changing global pandemic.
                “Thankfully, we’re in a better position now given the increased vaccination rates, so travel will more manageable and feasible,” said Paraskevi Noulas, PsyD, a psychologist at NYU Langone Health. “That said, we still have to exercise caution and be thoughtful about our travel plans.”
                First, it’s essential to acknowledge what living on the edge for the past year and a half has meant for our stress and anxiety levels.
                “Experiencing chronic stress has negative impacts on our overall health,” Noulas said. “As many have seen and experienced firsthand, routines are thrown off, activity levels drop, depressive and anxiety symptoms increase, and substance use increases. It’s a negative domino effect.”
                Being hypervigilant for extended periods can also wreak havoc on our nervous system.
                “It becomes increasingly difficult to shift into a calmer state physically and emotionally,” Noulas continued.
                For many Americans, this year may bring unique stressors when considering holiday travel, particularly when it comes to visiting family members who have chosen not to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
                Travelers this holiday season will also have to contend with new rules and regulations around testing and vaccination status depending on their destination and longer wait times to allow for these checks and more thorough sanitizing protocols than in years past.
                Below, we offer expert advice on how to deal with holiday travel stress during COVID-19 and what you can do to help make travel as smooth as possible.</p>             
                <p> <b> Travel the way you feel most comfortable</b>
                Many people have chosen to travel by car since the beginning of the pandemic.
                “It allows you to feel safe and comfortable in your own private space, to take your time getting to and from your destination, and to take as many breaks as needed or desired,” Noulas said.
                She notes that traveling by train is another option that offers some control — you can hop on and off fairly easily, get up and stretch, and walk to other compartments.
                If your destination requires you to travel by air, there are some steps you can take to ease stress and make the trip as comfortable as possible.
                “Try to sit in a part of the plane that is least populated, wear your mask at all times unless eating or drinking, and generously use hand sanitizer,” Noulas advised.</p>               
                <p> <b> Travel tips from the experts at Lonely Planet</b>
                Air travel looks differently today than before the pandemic. If traveling by plane, be aware that security checks may take longer with COVID-19 regulations in effect.
                Expect long lines at locations selling food or drink in the airport.
                Flight cancellations occur regularly. Make sure anything you’ll need in the following 24 hours, including a toothbrush, toothpaste, hand sanitizer, hand cream, lip balm, and medication you regularly take, is in your carry-on.
                Depending on your destination, documentation confirming your COVID-19 vaccination status or a negative COVID-19 antigen or PCR test may be needed to enter a country or access indoor venues such as museums and restaurants.
                Research the documentation you may need and have it ready before you travel.
                Get to the airport early 
                This holiday season might be their first time in an airport since before the pandemic for many in the United States. Air travel will look a bit different compared to then.
                “Give yourself a good chunk of additional time to what you allowed pre-COVID when traveling,” Fin McCarthy, editorial director at Lonely Planet, advised. “Security checks take a lot longer with COVID regulations, and expect long lines for anywhere selling food or drink in airport or train lounges.”</p>

                Have your COVID-19 documentation ready
                Depending on your destination, documentation confirming your COVID-19 vaccination status or a negative COVID-19 antigen or PCR test may be needed to enter a country or access indoor venues like museums and restaurants.
                Do your research to know what documentation will be needed and have it ready before you travel.
                “I would advise anyone traveling to bring multiple printouts of vaccination certificates with you,” McCarthy said. “Phones can get lost and lose battery life. Give everyone traveling in your group copies of relevant certs, and ensure everyone brings photo ID when out and about.”</p>
                
                <p> <b>Pack wisely</b>
                Because you might need to spend extra time at the airport due to COVID-19 regulations, planning and packing everything you’ll need is essential.
                “Bring snacks and food for the day in Tupperware so nothing gets squashed, and keep in mind the in-flight snack service on many routes is not the same level as what it was pre-COVID,” McCarthy said. “Take a book you know you will enjoy, a phone charger, and download several podcasts or audiobooks on your fully charged phone before leaving home.”
                 Make sure anything you’ll need in the following 24 hours, including a toothbrush, toothpaste, hand sanitizer, hand cream, lip balm, and medication you regularly take, is in your carry-on.
                “A warm shawl or scarf can be such an asset on a flight, and bring noise-canceling headphones if you have them,” McCarthy said. “Wear comfy shoes and cozy clothes. Dress as you would for a winter evening relaxing on your sofa at home.”</p>
